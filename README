Esdora requires a custom version of fedora. Located here: data/fedora/fcrepo-installer-modified-3.4.2.jar

This family of modules can be deployed by using features.

The following modules are included inline in the /modules folder of this repository and at some point should be changed to rely on thier canonical versions.

    islandora
    islandora_solr_search
    islandora_workflow

It looks like there have been some customizations applied to each of those modules.
